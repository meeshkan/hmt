Meeshkan is a tool that mocks HTTP APIs for use in sandboxes as well as for automated and exploratory testing. It uses a combination of API definitions, recorded traffic and code in order to make crafting mocks as enjoyable as possible.

## Installation
Install via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (requires **Python 3.6+**):

```bash
pip install meeshkan
```

macOS users can install Meeshkan with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew tap meeshkan/tap

```

Debian and Ubuntu users can install Meeshkan with `apt`:

```sh

```


## Getting started with Meeshkan

The basic Meeshkan flow is **collect, build and mock.**
1. First, **collect** data from recorded server traffic and/or OpenAPI specs.
1. Then, **build** a schema that unifies these various data sources.
1. Finally, use this schema to create a **mock** server of an API.

### Tutorial

The quickest way to get an overview of Meeshkan is to complete our [interactive tutorial](https://github.com/meeshkan/meeshkan-tutorial). It walks you through the collect, build, and mock flow - while also covering the concepts necessary for development.

First, install `meeshkan-tutorial` via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):

```bash
$ pip install meeshkan-tutorial
$ meeshkan-tutorial
```

_Note: This tutorial has been tested on Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8._

After installing, you can begin the tutorial by invoking from the command line:

```bash
$ meeshkan-tutorial
```

Once you've run this, you should see:

```bash
                             __    __
   ____ ___  ___  ___  _____/ /_  / /______ _____

## Collect recordings of API traffic

Let's look at how to build a Meeshkan spec. First, you have to **collect** recordings of server traffic and/or OpenAPI server specs.

To record API traffic, the Meeshkan CLI provides a `record` mode that captures API traffic using a proxy.

```bash
$ meeshkan record
```

This command starts Meeshkan as a reverse proxy on the default port of `8000` and creates two directories: `logs` and `specs`. 

With [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), for example, you can use Meeshkan as a proxy like so:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/http://api.example.com
```

By default, the recording proxy treats the path as the target URL. It then writes a [`.jsonl`](https://jsonlines.org) file containing logs of all server traffic to the `logs` directory.  All logs are created in the [`http-types`](https://github.com/meeshkan/http-types) format. This is because Meeshkan's `build` tool expects all recordings to be represented in a `.jsonl` file containing recordings represented in the `http-types` format.

For more information about recording, including direct file writing and kafka streaming, see the [recording documentation](./docs/RECORD.md).

## Build a Meeshkan spec from recordings

Using the Meeshkan CLI, you can **build** an OpenAPI schema from a single `.jsonl` file, in addition to any existing OpenAPI specs that describe how your service works.

```bash
$ meeshkan build --input-file path/to/recordings.jsonl 
```

_Note: The input file should be in [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) format and every line should be in [http-types](https://meeshkan.github.io/http-types/) JSON format. For an example input file, see [recordings.jsonl](./resources/recordings.jsonl)._

Optionally, you can also specify an output directory using the `--out` flag followed by the path to this directory. By default, Meeshkan will build the new OpenAPI specifications in the `specs` directory. 

Use dash (`--input-file -`) to read from standard input:

```bash
$ meeshkan build --input-file - < recordings.jsonl
```
### Building modes
You can use a mode flag to indicate how the OpenAPI spec should be built, for example:

```bash
meeshkan build --input-file path/to/recordings.jsonl --mode gen
```

Supported modes are:
* gen [default] - infer a schema from the recorded data
* replay - replay the recorded data based on exact matching

For more information about building, including mixing together the two modes and editing the created OpenAPI schema, see the [building documentation](./docs/BUILD.md).

## Mock server traffic using a Meeshkan spec

You can use an OpenAPI spec, such as the one created with `meeshkan build`, to create a **mock** server using Meeshkan.

```bash
$ meeshkan mock path/to/dir/
```

_Note: You can specify a path to the directory your OpenAPI spec is in or a path to one specific file._

For more information about mocking, including adding custom middleware and modifying the mocking schema JIT via an admin API, see the [mocking documentation](./docs/MOCK.md).

## Development

Here are some useful tips for building and running Meeshkan from source. 

If you run into any issues, please [reach out to our team on Gitter](https://gitter.im/Meeshkan/community).

### Getting started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/meeshkan/meeshkan`
1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
1. Install dependencies: `pip install --upgrade -e '.[dev]'`
1. Install [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to automatically format code as a git hook: `pre-commit install`

### Tests

Run all checks:

```bash
$ python setup.py test
```

#### `pytest`

Run [tests/](https://github.com/Meeshkan/meeshkan/tree/master/tests/) with `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
# or
python setup.py test
```

Configuration for `pytest` is found in [pytest.ini](https://github.com/Meeshkan/meeshkan/tree/master/pytest.ini).

#### Formatting

Formatting is checked by the above mentioned `python setup.py test` command.

To fix formatting:

```sh
$ python setup.py format
```

#### `flake8`

Run style checks:

```bash
$ flake8 .
```

#### `pyright`

You can run type-checking by installing [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) globally:

```bash
$ npm -i -g pyright
```

And then running:

```bash
$ pyright --lib
$ # or
$ python setup.py typecheck
```

Using the [Pyright extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-pyright.pyright) is recommended for development in VS Code.

### Automated builds

Configuration for CircleCI [build pipeline](https://app.circleci.com/github/Meeshkan/meeshkan/pipelines) can be found in [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/Meeshkan/meeshkan/tree/master/.circleci/config.yml).

### Publishing Meeshkan as a PyPi package

To publish Meeshkan as a PyPi package, complete the following steps:

1. Bump the version in [setup.py](https://github.com/Meeshkan/meeshkan/tree/master/setup.py) if the version is the same as in the published [package](https://pypi.org/project/meeshkan/). Commit and push.
1. Run `python setup.py test` to check that everything works
1. To build and upload the package, run `python setup.py upload`. Insert PyPI credentials to upload the package to `PyPI`. The command will also run `git tag` to tag the commit as a release and push the tags to remote.

> To see what the different commands do, see `Command` classes in [setup.py](https://github.com/Meeshkan/meeshkan/tree/master/setup.py).
